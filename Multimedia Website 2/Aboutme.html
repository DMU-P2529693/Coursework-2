      Hi, I’m Areeb and I specialise in videography and photography,Currently a second-year student a DeMontfort University studying Media Production, I have always wondered how production companies make such thrilling scenes in films and music videos and how are these visons are created. Throughout my studies I have developed and learn a large number of skills that gave me a clear indication on how stuff is run in the media industry.

      Whenever someone has chosen me to be their videographer or photographer I plan before the actual day of shoot. I visit the location given and think about the lighting and also what the best positions are for filming a particular scene. Sometimes I go as a team with other people such a lighting and sound engineers. If that’s the case, regular meetings are held between me and them were options are discussed. My flexibility allows me to work at events regardless of what time they are scheduled for.
      I have great creativity and customers are always happy with my work
      I hope whoever’s reading this would want to use my services and hopefully produce some stunning visuals.
      Thank You All
